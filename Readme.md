# Stroke Prediction with SVM

## Overview
This project applies **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on health-related features.  
Additionally, **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** is used to balance the dataset due to class imbalance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- Age
- Average glucose level
- BMI
- Other categorical and numerical features

The target variable is:
- Stroke (1 = stroke, 0 = no stroke)
